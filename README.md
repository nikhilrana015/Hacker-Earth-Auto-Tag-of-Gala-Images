# Hacker-Earth-Auto-Tag-of-Gala-Images


Problem statement

Galas are the biggest party of the year. Hosting firms of these events are well aware that everyone from around the world has their eyes on these nightsâ€”be it for inspiration or for critique. It takes months of meticulous planning and delegation to host these events impeccably.

One such firm has decided to take a data-driven approach for planning their gala nights. Aesthetics and entertainment are the most crucial segments of these events. So, this firm has hired you to help them aggregate and classify all images. These images are published by attendees and the paparazzi on various social media channels and other sources. You are required to build an image auto-tagging model to classify these images into separate categories.

Dataset

The dataset consists of 5,983 images that belong to 4 categories. These categories are food, attire, decor and signage.
